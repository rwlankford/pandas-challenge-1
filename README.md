Module 4 Challenge: Pandas

# Client Dataset Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing a client dataset. The analysis is divided into four parts: exploring the data, transforming the data, confirming the work, and summarizing and analyzing the results.

## Part 1: Explore the Data

In this part, the data is imported using Pandas, and basic exploration tasks are performed:
- Importing the data
- Displaying basic information about the dataset
- Viewing column names
- Displaying basic statistics about the dataset
- Conducting additional research to understand the data better, including determining top item categories, subcategories, top clients, and total units ordered by specific clients.

## Part 2: Transform the Data

The data is transformed to prepare it for analysis. This includes:
- Calculating subtotal, shipping price, total price, total cost, and profit for each line item
- Converting data types to float for numerical calculations

## Part 3: Confirm Your Work

In this part, the calculated total prices are confirmed against provided Order IDs.

## Part 4: Summarize and Analyze

Analysis is performed on the dataset, focusing on the top 5 clients by quantity defined in Part 1. This includes:
- Determining the total spend for each of the top 5 clients
- Creating a summary DataFrame showing total units purchased, total shipping price, total revenue, and total profit for the top 5 clients, sorted by total profit. The data is formatted for presentation.

### Repository Files
- `client_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `module_4_challenge.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the analysis process.
